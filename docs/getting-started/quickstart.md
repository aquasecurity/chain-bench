# Quick start
The primary way to run chain-bench is as a standalone cli. It requires an access token for your account and the repository url in order to access your SCM.

## Requirements
You must provide an access token with permission to these scopes: `repo`(all), `read:repo_hook`, `admin:org_hook`, `read:org`

## Supported Providers
 We currently support Github as the first SCM, with PAT authentication.

## For example

```shell
$ chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
