# Introduction

Chain-bench is an open-source tool for auditing your software supply chain stack for security compliance based on a new [CIS Software Supply Chain benchmark](/docs/CIS-Software-Supply-Chain-Security-Guide-v1.0.pdf).
The auditing focuses on the entire SDLC process, where it can reveal risks from code time into deploy time.

# Quick start

The primary way to run chain-bench is as a standalone cli. It requires an access token for your account and the repository url in order to access your SCM.

## Installation

Get Chain-bench via your favorite installation method. See [installation] section in the documentation for details. For example:

- `brew install chain-bench`
- `nix-env --install -A nixpkgs.chain-bench`
- `docker run aquasec/chain-bench`
- Download binary from https://github.com/aquasecurity/chain-bench/releases/latest/

## Usage

```bash
chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

### Using Self-hosted or Dedicated SCM Platforms (with custom domains)

```bash
chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --scm-platform <SCM_PLATFORM> --access-token <TOKEN> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

Supported options for `scm-platform` are `"github"` and `"gitlab"` (beta)

### Using docker

```bash
docker run aquasec/chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN>
```

### Using GitHub Actions

See the repository at https://github.com/aquasecurity/chain-bench-action

### Using Gitlab CI (beta)

You can integrated chain-bench results into [Gitlab Vulnrability Report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/) by adding a new step within your CI defintion:
```
chain-bench-scanning:
  stage: test
  image:
    name: docker.io/aquasec/chain-bench
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - chain-bench scan --repository-url $CI_PROJECT_URL --access-token $CHAIN_BENCH_TOKEN --scm-platform gitlab -o results.json --template @/templates/gitlab_security_scanner.tpl
  artifacts:
    reports:
      container_scanning: results.json
```
* You have to create new [token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) with `Maintainer` role that has `read_api` & `read_repository` permission and use it as environment variables (eg. $CHAIN_BENCH_TOKEN)


# Requirements

It is required to provide an access token with permission to these scopes: `repo`(all), `read:repo_hook`, `admin:org_hook`, `read:org`

# Supported Providers

We currently support Github and Gitlab SCMs, with PAT authentication.

# Please Note

Chain-bench implements the CIS Software Supply Chain Benchmark as closely as possible.
You can find the current implemented checks under [AVD - Software Supply Chain CIS - 1.0](https://avd.aquasec.com/compliance/softwaresupplychain/cis-1.0/) that update every night based chain-bench metadata.json files
Please raise issues here if chain-bench is not correctly implementing the test as described in the Benchmark. To report issues in the Benchmark itself (for example, tests that you believe are inappropriate), please join the CIS community.

# Contributing

Kindly read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
We welcome PRs and issue reports.

# Roadmap

Going forward we plan to release updates to chain-bench to increase the benchmark coverage with more checks and support more platforms.
chain-bench is an Aqua Security open source project part of Trivy Family.
