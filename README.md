Chain-bench is an open-source tool for auditing your software supply chain stack for security compliance based on a new CIS Software Supply Chain benchmark.
The auditing focuses on the entire SDLC process, where it can reveal risks from code time into deploy time. To win the race against hackers and protect your sensitive data and customer trust, you need to ensure your code is compliant with your organization‚Äôs policies.

# Introduction

Chain-bench is an open-source tool for auditing your software supply chain stack for security compliance based on a new CIS Software Supply Chain benchmark.
The auditing focuses on the entire SDLC process, where it can reveal risks from code time into deploy time. To

# Quick start

There is a primarily way to run chain-bench as a stand alone cli, that requires the personal access token of your account and the repository url in order to access your SCM.

## Usage

```
chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN> -o <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

### Using docker

```bash
docker run aquasec/chain-bench scan --repository-url <REPOSITORY_URL> --access-token <TOKEN>
```

## Examples

### Wasm

```bash
make start-wasm-example-web # start web server
make stop-wasm-example-web # tear down after you have done inspecting
```

# Requirements

It is required to provide an access token with permission to these scopes: `repo`(all), `read:repo_hook`, `admin:org_hook`, `read:org`

# Supported Providers

We currently support Github as the first SCM, with PAT authentication.

# Please Note

Chain-bench implements the CIS Software Supply Chain Benchmark as closely as possible.
You can find the current implemented checks under [AVD - Software Supply Chain CIS - 1.0](https://avd.aquasec.com/compliance/softwaresupplychain/cis-1.0/) that update every night based chain-bench metadata.json files
Please raise issues here if chain-bench is not correctly implementing the test as described in the Benchmark. To report issues in the Benchmark itself (for example, tests that you believe are inappropriate), please join the CIS community.

# Contributing

Kindly read [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
We welcome PRs and issue reports.

# Roadmap

Going forward we plan to release updates to chain-bench to increase the benchmark coverage with more checks and support more platforms.
chain-bench is an Aqua Security open source project part of Trivy Family.
